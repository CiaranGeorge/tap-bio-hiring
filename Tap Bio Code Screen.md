# Tap Bio Code Screen

## About Tap Bio

Tap Bio helps influencers, entrepreneurs, creators, and brands increase their conversion on Instagram by providing them with a mini-website, made and managed on their phone. We launched in early April to a very strong response. [TechCrunch made us blush](http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/tap-bio/ ""). 

## The Scene

You and a friend are sitting down for coffee one morning.  The weather is beautiful, and you remark that the weather has been wonderful this time of year for past several years.  Your friend, however, disagrees. They say that the weather has not been wonderful, in fact it has been downright dismal.  You and your friend bicker for a couple of minutes, but then you realize you can solve this issue technologically.  You tell your friend that you want to meet them at the same place tomorrow, and you will prove that the weather has been wonderful . . .

## The Ask

Being a software developer you know how to actually query historical weather information and display it in an elegant and functional way. What you intend to do is to create a Single Page Application that can query the weather from a specific location and specific day in the past. 

## The Tools

- Use any language you feel comfortable with, but since this is an SPA, we would prefer seeing ReactJS or something similar (Angular, etc.)
- Utilize the Dark Sky API [here](https://darksky.net/dev/docs "") for weather information. It is a well documented, and is a free API you can use.  
- Use any IaaS you'd like to as well, or even just post the code to Github for review. 

## The Process

Please take as much time as you like on this exercise, however we expect this to only take an afternoon of development.  In submitting your code, be sure to tell us approximately how long you spent. 

To submit, fork this repo and begin programming.  Include any assumptions or other tools used in your README.md file so we can track how you implemented. Again, don't go overboard here, just some breadcrumbs that can point us in the right direction. Also, if you host on an IaaS, please include a link to the live demo. 

## Finally

Have fun!  Programming should be an enjoyable exercise.  We are looking for someone who can enjoy what they do, perhaps show off a bit in code and be an integral part of our team.
